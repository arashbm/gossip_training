# Initialisation and Topology Effects in Decentralised Federated Learning

For running a simulation, generate a network in form of an edge file, using,
e.g., Reticula or NetworkX, and pass it to `main.py`. To see all parameters
and options, simply run `python main.py --help`.

To run an isolated node, use `isolated.py`. Run with `--help` argument to
see all options.
